# ATLYS Blockchain Protocol

ATLYS is a next-generation cross-chain communication protocol designed to enable seamless interoperability between disparate blockchain networks. This repository contains the Go implementation of the ATLYS protocol.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Secure and efficient message passing between different blockchain networks
- **Universal Bridge**: Standardized bridge interface supporting multiple blockchain architectures
- **Reputation-Based Consensus**: Novel validator selection mechanism using reputation scoring
- **Advanced Security**: Multi-signature support, threshold cryptography, and slashing conditions
- **Smart Contract Support**: Cross-chain smart contract execution capabilities
- **Asset Management**: Unified asset handling across different chains
- **P2P Network**: Robust peer-to-peer networking with automatic peer discovery

### Coding Standards

- Follow Go best practices and style guide
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Document all exported functions and types
- Include integration tests for new features

## Protocol Specifications

### Cross-Chain Bridge

The bridge module enables secure asset transfer and message passing between chains:

- Lock-and-Mint mechanism for asset transfers
- Multi-signature validation
- Atomic execution guarantees
- State verification using Merkle proofs

### Consensus Mechanism

ATLYS uses a reputation-based Proof of Stake consensus:

- Dynamic validator selection based on reputation scores
- Two-phase commit for finality
- Slashing conditions for misbehavior
- Automatic reputation adjustment

### Validator Requirements

- Minimum stake: 10,000 ATLYS
- 99.9% uptime requirement
- Hardware requirements:
  - 8 CPU cores
  - 16GB RAM
  - 1TB SSD
  - 100Mbps internet connection
